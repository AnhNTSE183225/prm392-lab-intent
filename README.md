## Exercise 6: Starting Activities (Explicit Intents)

### Technology Used:
- **Explicit Intents** with `Intent(this, TargetActivity.class)`
- **Data Transfer** using `putExtra()` and `getExtras()`
- **Activity Results** with `startActivityForResult()` and `onActivityResult()`
- **Toast Notifications** for user feedback

### Demonstration:

![Exercise 6 - Main Screen Input](demo-images/exercise6_main_input.png)
*Main screen with text input ready for Exercise 6*

*ResultActivity displaying received data and providing input for return value*

![Exercise 6 - Return Data](demo-images/exercise6_return_toast.png)
*Toast notification showing successfully returned data*

### What This Exercise Shows:
- Creating explicit intents to start specific activities
- Passing data between activities using intent extras
- Implementing bidirectional communication between activities
- Handling activity results and user feedback

## Exercise 7: Using the Share Intent

### Technology Used:
- **Implicit Intents** with `ACTION_SEND`
- **Intent Filters** in AndroidManifest.xml
- **MIME Type Handling** (`text/plain`)
- **Intent Chooser** for better user experience
- **System Integration** for receiving shared content

### Demonstration:

*Android share chooser showing available apps for sharing*

![Exercise 7 - Share Activity](demo-images/exercise7_share_received.png)
*ShareActivity displaying content received from another app*

![Exercise 7 - Share From External](demo-images/exercise7_external_share.png)
*Our app appearing in share options when sharing from another app*

### What This Exercise Shows:
- Sending data to other apps using share intents
- Registering as a share target for other applications
- Handling received shared content
- System-wide app integration

## Exercise 8: Register an Activity as Browser

### Technology Used:
- **Intent Filters** for `ACTION_VIEW` with HTTP scheme
- **URL Handling** and custom browser implementation
- **Network Operations** with proper permissions
- **HTML Content Processing** and display
- **System Browser Integration**

### Demonstration:

![Exercise 8 - Browser Choice](demo-images/exercise8_browser_chooser.png)
*System showing browser options including our custom browser*

![Exercise 8 - Custom Browser](demo-images/exercise8_custom_browser.png)
*Our BrowserActivity displaying raw HTML content*

![Exercise 8 - Default Browser](demo-images/exercise8_default_browser.png)
*Standard browser opened via intent from our app*

### What This Exercise Shows:
- Registering as a system component (browser)
- Handling URL intents and schemes
- Custom browser implementation
- Network permissions and operations

## Exercise 9: Picking an Image via an Intent

### Technology Used:
- **ActivityResultLauncher** (modern approach replacing startActivityForResult)
- **Content Provider Access** using `ACTION_GET_CONTENT`
- **Image Processing** with BitmapFactory
- **File URI Handling** and stream processing
- **MIME Type Filtering** for images

### Demonstration:

![Exercise 9 - Image Picker](demo-images/exercise9_image_picker.png)
*System image picker dialog showing available image sources*

![Exercise 9 - Image Selected](demo-images/exercise9_image_displayed.png)
*Selected image displayed in the app with success message*

![Exercise 9 - Gallery View](demo-images/exercise9_gallery_selection.png)
*Gallery interface during image selection process*

### What This Exercise Shows:
- Modern ActivityResultLauncher API usage
- Content URI handling and file access
- Image processing and display optimization
- User-friendly file selection interface

## Exercise 10: Using Different Implicit Intents

### Technology Used:
- **Multiple Implicit Intent Types** (8 different system actions)
- **Spinner UI Component** for intent selection
- **System Permissions** (CALL_PHONE, etc.)
- **URI Scheme Handling** (tel:, geo:, content:)
- **Error Handling** for missing system components

### Available Intent Types:
1. **Open Browser** - Launch web browser with URL
2. **Call Someone** - Direct phone call (requires permission)
3. **Dial** - Open dialer with pre-filled number
4. **Show Map** - Display location on map
5. **Search on Map** - Perform location search
6. **Take Picture** - Launch camera app
7. **Show Contacts** - Open contacts list
8. **Edit First Contact** - Open contact editor

### Demonstration:

![Exercise 10 - Intent Selector](demo-images/exercise10_spinner_selection.png)
*Spinner dropdown showing all available intent types*

![Exercise 10 - Phone Call](demo-images/exercise10_phone_call.png)
*Phone dialer opened via intent with pre-filled number*

![Exercise 10 - Map Location](demo-images/exercise10_map_location.png)
*Maps app showing location via geo intent*

![Exercise 10 - Camera Intent](demo-images/exercise10_camera_launch.png)
*Camera app launched via intent for photo capture*

### What This Exercise Shows:
- Comprehensive implicit intent usage patterns
- System service integration (phone, maps, camera, contacts)
- Permission handling for privileged operations
- Error handling and user experience considerations

## Key Features & Modern Practices

### Architecture Highlights:
- ‚úÖ **Modern APIs**: Uses ActivityResultLauncher instead of deprecated methods
- ‚úÖ **Proper Permissions**: Correct manifest declarations and runtime handling
- ‚úÖ **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of missing apps or denied permissions
- ‚úÖ **User Feedback**: Toast messages and visual feedback for all operations
- ‚úÖ **Material Design**: Clean, modern Android UI components

### System Integration:
- üì± **Share Target**: App can receive shared content from other applications
- üåê **Custom Browser**: Can handle HTTP URLs as alternative browser
- üì∑ **File Access**: Secure image selection from device storage
- üìû **System Services**: Integration with phone, maps, camera, and contacts

## Installation & Testing

1. **Clone** this repository
2. **Open** in Android Studio
3. **Build** and install on Android device/emulator
